        Builds RPMs for the develop and release-* branches on every commit. 
        Results are published to the yum repos at 
        https://beaker-project.org/nightlies/ which are used by QE and for 
        updating beaker-devel.

        # We don't need to keep many builds archived here in Jenkins,
